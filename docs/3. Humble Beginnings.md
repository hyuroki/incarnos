# 3. Humble Beginnings
## 3.1 First attempt 

My first idea was to find a good tutorial online in the hope of learning from there.
The first one I looked at was: 

https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/System-Development-for-Beginners/System-Development-Part-1-I-Made-This

This tutorial suggested to start out building your custom system by "borrowing" from an already existing "basic"-system already implemented by the maker of Foundry. And trying to change the things that are required.

Following the tutorial to a T, I learned the first structures and needed things for a very basic system. These things are:
- system.json
- template.json
- language
- css styles
- html sheets
- javascript interaction

These are the key elemental things to make the system work. But since the tutorial was heavily outdated (in the meantime of my journey, Foundry reached v10 and therefore changed a lot of things) I wasn't able to fully grasp to implement any meaningful features, let alone backend/frontend communication. My first build broke after I updated to v10 in the middle of me trying to figure things out. Nonetheless for a first structure, I learned that I needed to get more into web development if I wanted to be successfull. This step took me a good one month of time.

## 3.2 Second attempt

Unsatisfied with me unable to grasp the greater scheme of things due to outdated documentation, I was looking for another tutorial. This time I looked up a youtuber, that was going to implement a system from scratch with full explanations. I thought I found the holy grail (but not quite):

I knew from the beginning this video was even older than the first tutorial, so I braced myself to try and work bit by bit towards the goal with the expectation of having to understand the main principles in order to implement them for the newer v10. This video cemented my knowledge deeper and here is how I finished my first few things, as I will go closer into detail:

### 3.2.1 template.json

As I've learned, the basic information of actors (PCs and NPCs), and items (items, features, spells) could be declared here:

The template.json holds the basic structure of actor types, that would later be found in the Foundry GUI when declared here:

This is where I first learned how the template would actually affect the GUI and how it works. I willingly did not implement vehicles or monsters in template.json, but put them there to see what outcome it has in the GUI. Here I would later add all basic attributes and a few stats hardcoded in here.
I was also able to add all the basic templates for items here, these are mostly basic since I will mostly just use description:

The information in the template.json will be later accessible through the "data"-object in the Actor/Item-objects. What I didn't know at the time was, that v10 already got rid of these "data"-objects since the call for some of the information was "Actor.data.data.types" and after the change "Actor.system.types" in a much flatter hierarchy. This gave me a big headache since Foundry has little to no documentation that was useful outside of reverse-engineering my way through it.

### 3.2.2 system.json

Side by side, the system.json is equally important than the template.json. It requires basically all information to the system itself, and also holds all styles/esmodules together.

As I've tinkered around, I quickly realized that not many fields are needed, and there are many more fields that are useful. Since there is no documentation for these fields, I went and looked up other systems on what they used in order to find what is needed such as gridDistance and gridUnits, that represent the movement of the PCs. 

Worth mentioning: All the packs implemented here (in case I ever want to release a pack for myself), might be useful to third parties in the future. These packs might contain pictures, music, background text, scripts, etc.. These will become important moving forward in the future, but are not important for the initial system. The maingoal for packs would be to be able to share content (, that has been made before) for other players to use.
