## 1.1 What is Pen and Paper?

Pen and Paper (short PnP) is a genre of Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs). PnP is the first form of RPG video games before computers were invented. One could say that video games are just automations of what happens in a PnP game.

Popular PnP games have different game systems, such as Dungeons&Dragons, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu. There are countless numbers of systems, but for this project it is important to understand that each game inherit their own base core rules that need to be implemented to make the game functional.

PnP games can run from 1-n amount of players, but usually entail 3-4 players and 1 gamemaster. It is safe to assume that a normal number of participants is ~5 players.
