## 4.1 Third attempt and final product

After following the tutorial and figuring out the differences of v10 and the tutorial's version, I finally began to understand how to make my first sheets. I began learning Html and CSS but realized very quickly that I am in no shape or form adept in webdevelopment. I was also struggling to understand the inner concepts because of the out-of-date tutorial. So I went on search again for another resource to learn from and ended up to my third and last resource:

https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/SD-tutorial/SD012-Other-options

This source recommends building the system with a boilerplate approach.
It goes similarily in depth like the 2nd tutorial but instead is much more up-to-date. This tutorial filled most of my knowledge gaps and I was finally ready to implement all the features I envisioned in the beginning of my project. This took me half a year to get to this point but from here on everything would be much easier.

## 4.2 Character/Npc-Sheets

Character/NPC-Sheets look very similar except NPCs have one more attribute (CR) than the characters. Therefore I will show you the NPC Sheets and its implementation:
